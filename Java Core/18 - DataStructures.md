# What is a Data Structure in Java?

- The term data structure refers to a data collection with well-defined operations and behavior or properties. 
- A data structure is a unique way of storing or organizing the data in computer memory so that we can use it effectively.


# The need for Data Structures in Java

As the amount of data grows rapidly, applications get more complex, and there may arise the following problems:

- ```Processing Speed:``` As the data is increasing day by day, high-speed processing is required to handle this massive amount of data, but the processor may fail to deal with that much amount of data.
- ```Searching data:``` Consider an inventory with a size of 200 items. If your application needs to search for a particular item, it needs to traverse 200 items in every search. This results in slowing down the search process.
- ```Multiple requests at the same time:```** Suppose, millions of users are simultaneously searching the data on a web server, then there is a chance of server failure.

# Advantages of Java Data Structures

- ```Efficiency:``` Data Structures are used to increase the efficiency and performance of an application by organizing the data in such a manner that it requires less space with higher processing speed.
- ```Reusability:``` Data structures provide reusability of data, that is after implementing a particular data structure once, we can use it many times at any other place. We can compile the implementation of these data structures into libraries and the clients can use these libraries in many ways.
- ```Abstraction:``` In Java, the ADT (Abstract Data Types) is used to specify a data structure. The ADT provides a level of abstraction. The client program uses the data structure with the help of the interface only, without having knowledge of the implementation details.

- ```Linear Data Structures:``` In a linear data structure all the elements are arranged in the linear or sequential order. The linear data structure is a single level data structure.
- ```Non-Linear Data Structures:``` The non-linear data structure does not arrange the data in a sequential manner as in linear data structures. Non-linear data structures are the multilevel data structure.

# Types of Data Structure in Java

There are some common types of data structure in Java they are as follows –

1. [Arrays](https://github.com/alejoalvarez/Java/blob/main/Java%20Core/Arrays.md)
2. [Linked Lists](https://github.com/alejoalvarez/Java/blob/main/Java%20Core/LinkedList.md)
3. [Stack](https://github.com/alejoalvarez/Java/blob/main/Java%20Core/Stack.md)
4. [Queue](https://github.com/alejoalvarez/Java/blob/main/Java%20Core/Queue.md)
