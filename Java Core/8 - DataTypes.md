# Data Types

- Primitive Type
- Object Type

## Primitive Type
- They have no methods
- They are not objects
- They do not need an invocation to be created
- short, int, char, boolean
- There are 8 types of primitive data types:
    - boolean data type
    - byte data type
    - char data type
    - short data type
    - int data type
    - long data type
    - float data type
    - double data type

## Object Type (Wrapper)
- With methods
- They need an invocation to be created
- Types of the standard library - String, it is for text chain others are (Scanner, TreeSet, ArrayList ...), include Classes, Intefaces and Arrays.
- User-defined types, example (Car, Bus, People etc)
- Array types - vector or matrix type elements, they are special objects that lack methods


Note: ```The difference between int and Integer is that Integer being a wrapper allows null```

## Type casting

Type casting is when you assign a value of one primitive data type to another type.

In Java, there are two types of casting:

Widening Casting (automatically) - converting a smaller type to a larger type size
```byte``` -> ```short``` -> **```char``` -> ```int``` -> ```long``` -> ```float``` -> ```double```

Narrowing Casting (manually) - converting a larger type to a smaller size type
```double``` -> ```float``` -> ```long``` -> ```int``` -> ```char``` -> ```short``` -> ```byte```
