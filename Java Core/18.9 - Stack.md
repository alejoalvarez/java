# Stack

- A stack is a LIFO (Last In First Out) data structure that can be physically implemented as an `Array` or as a `LinkedList`.
- Insertion and deletion of elements in a stack occur at the top end only.
- An insertion in a stack is called `push` and deletion from a stack is called `pop`.
- When we implement a stack as an array, it inherits all the properties of an Array
- When we implement it as a linked list, it acquires all the properties of a LinkedList

## Common operations on a stack are:

- `push():` Adds an item to the top of the stack.
- `pop():` Removes the item from the top of the stack
- `Peek():` It tells us what is on the top of the stack without removing it. Sometimes, we can also call it top().

**Stacks are useful in:**

- Parenthesis matching
- Solving the maze problem
- Nested Function calls
