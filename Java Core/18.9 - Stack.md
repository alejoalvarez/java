# Stack

- A stack is a LIFO (Last In First Out) data structure that can be physically implemented as an `Array` or as a `LinkedList`.
- Insertion and deletion of elements in a stack occur at the top end only.
- An insertion in a stack is called `push` and deletion from a stack is called `pop`.
- When we implement a stack as an array, it inherits all the properties of an Array
- When we implement it as a linked list, it acquires all the properties of a LinkedList

## Common operations on a stack are:

- `push():` Adds an item to the top of the stack.
- `pop():` Removes the item from the top of the stack
- `Peek():` It tells us what is on the top of the stack without removing it. Sometimes, we can also call it top().

**Stacks are useful in:**

- Parenthesis matching
- Solving the maze problem
- Nested Function calls


Example
```java
import java.util.Stack;

public class ExampleStack {

    public static void main(String[] args) {

        Stack<String> stack1 = new Stack<String>();
        System.out.println("Insert 3 elements in the stack: Juan, Ana and Luis");
        stack1.push("Juan");
        stack1.push("Ana");
        stack1.push("Luis");
        System.out.println("Number of elements in the stack:" + stack1.size());
        System.out.println("Extract the first element:" + stack1.pop());
        System.out.println("Number of elements in the stack:" + stack1.size());
        System.out.println("Consult the first element in the stack without extracting it:" + stack1.peek());
        System.out.println("Number of elements in the stack:" + stack1.size());
        System.out.println("Extract one by one each element from the stack as long as it is not empty:");
        while (!stack1.isEmpty()){
            System.out.print(stack1.pop() + "-");
            System.out.println();
        }

        Stack<Integer> stack2 = new Stack<Integer>();
        stack2.push(70);
        stack2.push(120);
        stack2.push(6);
        System.out.println("delete the entire stack");
        stack2.clear();
        System.out.println("Number of elements in the stack:" + stack2.size());
    }
}
