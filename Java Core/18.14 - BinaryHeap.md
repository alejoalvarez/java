# Binary Heap

A Binary Heap is another hierarchical data structure that is similar to a Complete Binary Tree with some additional properties. A complete binary tree is a binary tree with no nodes with only one child; except the deepest level. The common use of binary heaps is to implement priority queues.

The Binary heap has the following properties:

- A Binary Heap can be either a Min Heap or a Max Heap.
- In a Min Binary Heap, the data at the root must be minimum among all data present in Binary Heap.
- In a Max Binary Heap, the data at the root must be maximum among all data present in Binary Heap.
