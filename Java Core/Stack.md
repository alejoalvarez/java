# Stack

A stack is a LIFO (Last In First Out) data structure that can be physically implemented as an array or as a linked list. Insertion and deletion of elements in a stack occur at the top end only. An insertion in a stack is called pushing and deletion from a stack is called popping.

When we implement a stack as an array, it inherits all the properties of an array and if we implement it as a linked list, it acquires all the properties of a linked lis

## Common operations on a stack are:

- **Push():** Adds an item to the top of the stack.
- **Pop():** Removes the item from the top of the stack
- **Peek():** It tells us what is on the top of the stack without removing it. Sometimes, we can also call it top().

**Stacks are useful in:**

- Parenthesis matching
- Solving the maze problem
- Nested Function calls
