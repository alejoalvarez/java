# JDK-JRE-JVM

**JDK** is Composed of 3 things:
- JDK - (Java Virtual Machine) => Just in Time compiler (JIT)
- **JRE**Â - Java Runtime Environment, contain the (JVM, libraries, javaw, etc)
- JVM - (Java Virtual Machine) => Just in Time compiler (JIT)

# JDK - Java Development Kit

- Is a software development environment which is used to develop Java applications and applets. It physically exists. It contains JRE + development tools.
- The JDK contains a private Java Virtual Machine (JVM) and a few other resources such as an interpreter/loader (java), a compiler (javac), an archiver (jar), a documentation generator (Javadoc), etc. to complete the development of a Java Application.

**Components JDK**

|appletviewer: |	This tool is used to run and debug Java applets without a web browser.|
|---|---|
|apt: |	It is an annotation-processing tool.|
|extcheck: |	it is a utility that detects JAR file conflicts.|
|idlj: |	An IDL-to-Java compiler. This utility generates Java bindings from a given Java IDL file.|
|jabswitch:	| It is a Java Access Bridge. Exposes assistive technologies on Microsoft Windows systems.|
|java: |	The loader for Java applications. This tool is an interpreter and can interpret the class files generated by the javac compiler. Now a single launcher is used for both development and deployment. The old deployment launcher, jre, no longer comes with Sun JDK, and instead it has been replaced by this new java loader.|
|javac: |	It specifies the Java compiler, which converts source code into Java bytecode.|
|javadoc: |	The documentation generator, which automatically generates documentation from source code comments|
|jar: |	The specifies the archiver, which packages related class libraries into a single JAR file. This tool also helps manage JAR files.|
|javafxpackager: |	It is a tool to package and sign JavaFX applications.|

|javaws: | the Java Web Start launcher for JNLP applications.|
|JConsole: |	Java Monitoring and Management Console.|
|jdb:	| the debugger.|
|jhat:	| Java Heap Analysis Tool (experimental).|
|jinfo:	| This utility gets configuration information from a running Java process or crash dump.|
|jmap:	| Oracle jmap - Memory Map- This utility outputs the memory map for Java and can print shared object memory maps or heap memory details of a given process or core dump.|
|jmc:	| Java Mission Control|
|jps:	| Java Virtual Machine Process Status Tool lists the instrumented HotSpot Java Virtual Machines (JVMs) on the target system.|
|jrunscript:	|Java command-line script shell.|
|jstack:	| It is a utility that prints Java stack traces of Java threads (experimental).|
|jstat:	| Java Virtual Machine statistics monitoring tool (experimental).|
|jstatd:	| jstat daemon (experimental).|
|keytool:	| It is a tool for manipulating the keystore.|
|pack200:	| JAR compression tool.|
|Policytool:	| It specifies the policy creation and management tool, which can determine policy for a Java runtime, specifying which permissions are available for code from various sources.|
|VisualVM:	| It is a visual tool integrating several command-line JDK tools and lightweight [clarification needed] performance and memory profiling capabilities|
|wsimport:	| It generates portable JAX-WS artifacts for invoking a web service.|
|1xjc:	|It is the part of the Java API for XML Binding (JAXB) API. It accepts an XML schema and generates Java classes.|

# JRE

- Named at the beginning as JVM, it is made up of the JVM, some classes of the core of the platform and libraries of the own language
- is a set of software tools which are used for developing Java applications


# JVM

- It is a specification that provides a runtime environment in which Java bytecode can be executed
- JVM is specific for each operating system.
- Find the main method to start the application

The JVM performs the following main tasks:

- Loads code
- Verifies code
- Executes code
- Provides runtime environment

JVM provides definitions for the:

- Memory area
- Class file format
- Register set
- Garbage-collected heap
- Fatal error reporting etc.

### Class Loader

Class loader is a subsystem of JVM which is used to load class files. There are three built-in class loaders in Java.

- **Bootstrap ClassLoader**: This is the first class loader which is the super class of Extension class loader. It loads the rt.jar file which contains all class files of Java Standard Edition like java.lang package classes, java.net package classes, java.util package classes, java.io package classes, java.sql package classes etc.
- **Extension ClassLoader**: This is the child class loader of Bootstrap and parent class loader of System class loader. It loades the jar files located inside $JAVA_HOME/jre/lib/ext directory.
- **Application ClassLoader**: This is the child class loader of Extension class loader. It loads the class files from class path. By default, class path is set to current directory. You can change the class path using "-cp" or "-class path" switch. It is also known as Application class loader.

#### Initialization

This operation involves the assignment of all static variables with their specific values in the block of the program. In this phase, there is an assignment of all static variables with their values defined in the code and static block.

#### Loading

This operation loads files from secondary memory into the main memory (RAM) for execution. The Class loader reads the .class file, generates the corresponding binary data, and saves it in the method area.

JVM stores some information for each .class file in the method area. This information is:

- The fully qualified name of the loaded class and its immediate parent class.
- Whether .class file is related to interface or an enum or a class.
- Modifier, Variables and Method information, etc.
- After loading the .class file, JVM creates an object of type Class to represent this file in the heap memory. The programmers can use this Class object for getting class level information like the name of the class, parent name, methods, and variable information, etc. To get this object reference we can use the getClass() method of Object class.

#### Linking
This operation combines different files in the main program together. It performs verification, preparation, and (optionally) resolution.

## JVM Memory area
- **Method Area**: It stores the structure of each class like method data, field data, runtime pool, metadata.
- **Heap**: Heap is the runtime area where object allocation takes place.
- **Stacks**: Stacks store the partial results and local variables of a program. Whenever a thread is created, there is a simultaneous creation of JVM stack. When we invoke a method, a new frame creates and destroys at the same time when the invocation process completes.
- **PC Registers**: It stores the address of the currently executing JVM instruction.
- **Native Method Stacks**: It includes all the native methods required in any application. It is not written in java.

## Execution Engine
It contains:

- A virtual processor
- Interpreter: Read bytecode stream then execute the instructions.
- Just-In-Time(JIT) compiler: It is used to improve the performance. JIT compiles parts of the byte code that have similar functionality at the same time, and hence reduces the amount of time needed for compilation. Here, the term "compiler" refers to a translator from the instruction set of a Java virtual machine (JVM) to the instruction set of a specific CPU.

## Java Native Interface
Java Native Interface (JNI) is a framework which provides an interface to communicate with another application written in another language like C, C++, Assembly etc. Java uses JNI framework to send output to the Console or interact with OS libraries.

## Method Libraries

Native Libraries is a collection of the Native Libraries(C, C++) which are essential for the Execution Engine.

## Difference between JDK, JRE, JVM 

The following are a few important differences between JDK, JVM, and JRE.

- JVM stands for Java Virtual machine, JDK stands for Java development kit, and JRE stands for Java runtime environment.
- JDK is for the development environment whereas JRE is for the run time environment.
- JVM runs inside the JRE environment. JRE contains class libraries, Java Virtual Machine and other files other than development tools like compiler and debugger.
- JRE is a subset of JDK. JDK contains JRE along with development tools such as compiler, debugger, etc.
